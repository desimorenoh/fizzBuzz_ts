# FizzBuzz Kata in TypeScript

This is a TypeScript implementation of the FizzBuzz Kata. The goal of this Kata is to write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz".
